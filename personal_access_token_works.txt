Use the following for online reference:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token



the key worked with the following
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
will be good until November 25th then will have to update

After successfully adding running the command 'git config credential.helper store' in the command line from the Intro to Python repo
the file "git-credentials' was created in my home repo and the contents are below. Automatically connects without me havinbg to
manually enter the username and personal acces token

Update after line above. Seems like after I pasted the line above which contains the active key, I beleive based on my observation that
Github is running a security check of the contents in the backgroud for any stored keys that match text in any of the keys stored for the account
If it sees a match I beleive that it is revoking the key(s) for the account access.
So lesson learned. DO NOT KEEP KEY INFO INSIDE ANY REPO.
Just run the 'git config credential.helper store' command and then login with the key via the command line and th key will be saved in teh
file as indicated ablve.
